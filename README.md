# codewarbler

**clear tech. sharp code. no noise.**

we build tools that get out of your way — for devs who don't need hand-holding or "AI magic."  
solid frontends, fast backends, and mocking infra that doesn't collapse under load.  
if you're into minimal setups, working code, and dry humor — welcome.
