# codewarbler

**clear tech. sharp code. no noise.**

we write tools for people who'd rather read a log than a newsletter.  
you won’t find a mascot here. no “AI-powered synergy,” no onboarding flows with fireworks.  
just code that works, docs that don’t lie, and infra that doesn’t scream at scale.

---

## what we do

- frontend plugins that actually load
- backend services that don’t panic at the first user
- mocking stacks that let you break things before production does
- automation flows that assume you have a brain
- integrations for platforms that weren’t meant to be extended, but were anyway

---

## why

because most of modern dev culture is loud, slow, and fragile.  
because we don’t want to “leverage scalable solutions,” we want to ship clean ones.  
because nobody should need 12 microservices and a blog post to move a file.  
because we got tired of magic, middleware, and Markdown lies.

---

## who this is for

- devs who know how to grep
- teams who’d rather debug than wait on vendor support
- builders who test before they tweet
- people who still write Makefiles (or want to)

---

## tech stack

no fanboyism — we use what works, and we keep it swappable.

**frontend**

- react (when needed), preact (when not)
- tailwind (because CSS is noise)
- vite, esbuild, rollup
- twig, htmx, alpine.js
- shadcn/ui, lucide-react, framer motion
- raw DOM (because plugins still live in the real world)

**backend**

- node.js, express, fastify
- php (yes, the grown-up version), symfony
- kotlin + ktor for structured pain
- python (for glue), go (for speed), bash (for war)
- custom-built mocks, not “testing frameworks”
- clean, schema-first APIs (OpenAPI, Pact)

**infra**

- docker, docker-compose, k3s
- nginx, caddy
- wiremock, mockoon, echoserve
- playwright, curl, jq, httpie
- nginx, cron, rsync, ssh

**data**

- sqlite for local sanity
- postgres for real work
- redis (when needed, never first)
- minio / s3 (with eyes open)
- kafka (rarely — and reluctantly)

**tooling**

- git, gh, pre-commit, husky
- make, just, taskfile
- tmux, zsh, fzf, ripgrep
- self-hosted CI or GitHub Actions — no GitLab YAML soup

**misc**

- pact for contracts, not ceremonies
- wiremock for stubbing, not guessing
- OpenAPI that doesn’t need 6 extensions to be useful
- zod or io-ts for runtime validation — typed, not magical

---

## principles

- minimalism is default, not an aesthetic
- no unlogged retry loops
- failure should be loud, fast, and useful
- tests should be real, not green checkmarks
- “good enough” is a trap — build it solid or skip it
- docs are part of the code, not a brochure

---

## how we work

no community calls. no Slack noise. no Discord cults.  
we ship code, open issues, write real docs.  
no roadmap promises, no “next-gen” banners.  
just versioned progress.

---

## contact

want to collaborate? open a PR.  
have a bug? open an issue.  
need a plugin, script, or fix that doesn’t exist yet?  
make it — or ask loud enough and we might.
